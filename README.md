# SF30thPlayerReader
Reads lobby player names from SF30thAnniversaryCollection process memory and writes them to text files in the running directory that can be used to auto-update Twitch overlays.

## Usage

1. Download and unzip the latest [SF30thPlayerReader.zip](https://github.com/damdai/SF30thPlayerReader/releases/latest).
2. Launch Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection from Steam and create or join a lobby.
3. Run SF30thPlayerReader.exe.

The following files will be created in the same directory and updated whenever a change is detected:
